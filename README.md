# FlappyCxx for Android
Based on example from AndroidNDK. I reconfigured gradle and changed jni wrapper to work with FlappyCxx.
The project contains a submodule FlappyCxx written on C++. To clone with submodules:

	git clone https://github.com/mrtrizer/FlappyCxxAndroid.git
	cd FlappyCxxAndroid
	git submodule update --init
